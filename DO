DevOps and Agile Methodology are both software development approaches that emphasize collaboration and continuous improvement. However, there are some key differences between the two:

Focus: Agile Methodology focuses on delivering working software quickly and efficiently, while DevOps focuses on the entire software development lifecycle, from development to deployment to operations.

Goals: Agile Methodology aims to deliver high-quality software quickly and respond to changing requirements or priorities, while DevOps aims to improve the efficiency and reliability of the software development pipeline.

Practices: Agile Methodology includes practices such as Scrum and Kanban, while DevOps includes practices such as continuous integration and continuous deployment.

Team Structure: Agile Methodology emphasizes self-organizing teams, while DevOps emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams.



Branching is a technique in version control systems, such as Git, that allows developers to create separate lines of development from the main codebase. Branches can be used to isolate new features or bug fixes and prevent them from interfering with the main codebase until they are ready to be merged.

Branching is required for several reasons:

Isolation: Branching allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

Collaboration: Branching enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without interfering with each other's work.

Experimentation: Branching enables developers to experiment with new features or techniques without affecting the main codebase.




Devops life cycles and stages:
1. Plan code
2. Build
3. Test
4. Release
5. Deploy
6. Operate
&. Monitor

Stages:
1. Continues Development : tools are Git, SVN, Mercurial, CVS.
2. Integration : jenkins, teamcity, Trevis.
3. Testing : Jenkins, Selenium, TestNG, Junit
4. Development : Configuration management, Chef, puppet, Ansible - Containerization - Docker - Vagrant.
5. Monitor : Splunk, ELK stack, Nagios, New Relic.

Roles and responcibilities:
