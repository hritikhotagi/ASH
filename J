Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice in software development that involves regularly integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. The code changes are automatically built, tested, and verified to ensure that they do not break the application's functionality.

The features of Continuous Integration include:

Automated builds: CI tools automatically build the application whenever new code changes are pushed to the repository.

Automated testing: CI tools run automated tests on the application to ensure that it functions as expected.

Code analysis: CI tools can perform static code analysis to identify potential issues, such as code smells or security vulnerabilities.

Continuous feedback: CI tools provide feedback to developers on the status of their code changes, such as whether the build was successful or whether any tests failed.



Continuous Integration offers several benefits, including:

Faster time to market: CI helps to accelerate the software development process by catching issues early in the development cycle.

Improved code quality: CI tools help to identify and fix issues before they make it into production.

Increased collaboration: CI encourages collaboration between developers by making it easier to share code changes and feedback.

Reduced risk: CI helps to reduce the risk of bugs or other issues in the application by catching them early in the development cycle.
